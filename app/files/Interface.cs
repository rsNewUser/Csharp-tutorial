/*
interfaces are similar to abstraction there are no methods 
with defined bodies interfaces are completely classes with abstraction
interfaces can also be used for multiple inheritance as there is 
no multiple inheritance concept in C#

interface is not a mix of abstraction and it is completely made of methods and properties
which have no body
